## UFOs

# Overview: 

The project involves creating a website to display data related to reported UFO sightings. The site will be built using a combination of Javascript, HTML and Bootstrap. In addition to being visually appealing, the site must have functionality that allows the user to perform searches using various filters given the large volumn of data .

# Results:

To query the data the user will navigate to the webpage and, using the search criteria filters, narrow the subset of data that is of interest. For instance, the user is interested in sightings that took place in California:

But more specifically in El Cajon, California:

And on 4 January 2010

This fuctionality allows the user experience to be seamless when searching and eliminates the need to scroll through volumns of data.

# Summary: 

One drawback of the current webite design is the inability to export data by the end user. Futher recommended developement would include adding an export function, the ability for UFO sightings to be submitted to consideration via teh websie, and additional UFO sighting content and links to other resources.
